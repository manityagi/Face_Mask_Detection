# Face_Mask_Detection
Real time Face Mask Detection on video streams using Python, Keras, OpenCV and MobileNET.                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                            
# To run this on your local machine. Do the following
1) Extract the dataset into the file directory first                                                                             
2) Run train_mask_detector.py (This will train and save the model in h5 format)                                                    
3) Run detect_mask_video.py (This will initialise a webcam window on the local machine)
