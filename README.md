# Face_Mask_Detection
Real time Face Mask Detection on video streams using Python, Keras, OpenCV and MobileNET.                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                            
To run this on your local machine. Type the following commands in the terminal. 
Extract the dataset into the file directory first                                                                             
python train_mask_detector.py (This will train and save the model in h5 format)                                                    
python detect_mask_video.py (This will initialise a webcam window on the local machine)
